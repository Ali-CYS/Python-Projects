# Cyber Security Projects (Python)

This folder contains Python-based cybersecurity projects demonstrating key security concepts through practical implementation.  

## Projects Included

### 1. Keylogger (Educational Purpose Only)
A simple script that records user keystrokes to demonstrate how keyloggers work.

#### Working
- Listens to keyboard events.
- Logs all keystrokes and saves them to a file.
- Highlights how attackers may exploit insecure systems.
#### Usage
1. Clone the rep.
   ```
   gh repo clone Ali-CYS/Python-Projects
   ```
2. Navigate to the `Keylogger` folder:
   ```bash
   cd Cyber-Security/Keylogger
   ```
3. ```bash
   pip install pynput
    ```
4. ```bash
   python keylogger.py
    ```

### 2. Hash Verifier (Password Hashing with Salting)
A secure password hashing and verification script that demonstrates salting to protect passwords.

### Working
- Accepts a password and generates a salted hash.
- Stores the hash and verifies user-entered passwords.
- Prevents attacks like rainbow table exploits.

#### Usage
1. Clone the rep.
   ```
   gh repo clone Ali-CYS/Python-Projects
   ```
2. Navigate to the `Keylogger` folder:
   ```bash
   cd Cyber-Security/Keylogger
   ```

3. ```bash
   python hashverifier.py
    ```
